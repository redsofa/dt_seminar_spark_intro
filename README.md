# Introduction to Apache Spark 
### Tech Talk Companion Repository

The tech talk introduces Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing. 
The talk also demonstrates how Spark makes an excellent addition to any data analysis toolkit. 
Through demos we will cover:

* Launching a simulated Spark cluster.
* Submitting simple jobs with tailored resource requirements.
* Performing common data transformations.
* Training a simple Spark MLlib algorithm for used-vehicle price prediction.
